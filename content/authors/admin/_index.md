I earned a B.S. in psychology from St. Thomas Aquinas College in 2017 and a M.S. in cognitive psychology from the Pennsylvania State University in 2019. Currently, I am investigating the effects of aging on memory and creativity using fMRI and behavioral paradigms. In previous lines of work, I explored the longitudinal effects of exercise on cognition and aging, as well as investigated interaction effects of personality traits with related variables such as procrastination and social media. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, baking, and reading.
